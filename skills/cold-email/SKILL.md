# Cold Email Writing

Write B2B cold emails optimized for reply rates. Based on data from 85M+ analyzed emails (Gong), 16.5M campaigns (Belkins), and billions of scored messages (Lavender).

## Required Inputs

Before writing, gather or confirm:

1. **Prospect info** — Name, role, company, industry, company size
2. **Research signals** — At least one: recent funding, job postings, LinkedIn activity, tech stack, company news, podcast/talks, website changes
3. **Value proposition** — The specific problem solved and for whom
4. **Social proof** — A relevant case study: [Similar Company] + [Specific Result] + [Timeframe]
5. **Sequence context** — First touch, follow-up number, or breakup email

If the user hasn't provided these, ask before writing.

## Core Principles (ranked by impact)

### 1. Select the right hook type

Timeline hooks outperform problem hooks by **3.4x in meetings booked**.

| Hook type    | Reply rate | Meeting rate | When to use                        |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Timeline     | 10.01%     | 2.34%        | Trigger events, deadlines, seasons |
| Numbers      | 8.57%      | 1.86%        | Strong quantified results          |
| Social proof | 7.12%      | 1.21%        | Recognizable client wins           |
| Problem      | 4.39%      | 0.69%        | Only when pain is acute + specific |

### 2. Personalize to the problem, not the person

Every personalized element must logically connect to the problem you solve. Remove the personalization — if the email still makes sense, it isn't doing its job.

See [personalization.md](references/personalization.md) for the 4-level system and research signals.

### 3. Keep it radically short and human

- **50–80 words** for cold openers. Never exceed 125.
- **3rd–5th grade reading level**: no sentence over 20 words, no word over 3 syllables unless it's a proper noun.
- "You/your" should appear **3x more** than "I/we." Every sentence should serve the reader.
- 2–3 line paragraphs max. Generous white space. Plain text only.
- **Tone: conversational-professional.** Write like a peer talking to a peer — not texting a friend, not pitching on Shark Tank. Use contractions. Read it aloud; if it doesn't sound like speech, rewrite.

### 4. Use interest-based CTAs, not meeting asks

Soft CTAs ("Worth a chat?" / "Open to exploring?") outperform hard CTAs ("Book a meeting here"). One CTA per email. Under 6 words. Close-ended yes/no.

### 5. Subject lines: short, boring, internal-looking

- **2–4 words**, lowercase, no punctuation tricks.
- Look like an internal email ("reply rates", "hiring ops", "Q2 forecast").
- No salesy words, numbers, emojis, urgency, or product pitches.
- Never use prospect's first name (signals automation).

See [subject-lines.md](references/subject-lines.md) for full rules and data.

### 6. Follow-ups must add new value

Each follow-up uses a different angle. Never "just checking in." 3–5 total emails with increasing gaps. 55% of replies come from follow-ups.

See [follow-up-sequences.md](references/follow-up-sequences.md) for cadence and angle rotation.

## Framework Selection

Default to PAS for most situations. Match to context:

| Framework          | Best for                                   | Structure                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **PAS**            | Problem-aware prospects (default)          | Problem → Agitate → Solution              |
| **BAB**            | Transformation stories, emotional buyers   | Before → After → Bridge                   |
| **QVC**            | C-suite, ultra-brevity needed              | Question → Value → CTA                    |
| **Star-Story-Sol** | Strong case study available                | Character → Challenge → Result            |
| **PPP**            | Genuine trigger event to praise            | Praise → Picture → Push                   |
| **3C's (Berman)**  | Agency/services with vertical case studies | Compliment → Case Study → CTA             |
| **Mouse Trap**     | Maximum brevity, curiosity-driven          | Observation + Binary question (1–2 lines) |

See [frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for all frameworks with examples.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess inputs

Confirm prospect info, research signals, value prop, and social proof. Ask for missing pieces.

### Step 2: Select framework + hook type

Match framework to prospect seniority and awareness level. Default to timeline or numbers hooks.

### Step 3: Write the email

Five-line structure:

```
[Personalized trigger/observation — 1 sentence]
[Pain point connection — 1 sentence]
[Social proof/specific result — 1 sentence]
[Concise value connection — 1 sentence]
[Low-friction CTA — 1 sentence]
```

### Step 4: Self-check

Before presenting:

- [ ] Under 80 words?
- [ ] 3rd–5th grade reading level? (no sentence >20 words, no word >3 syllables)
- [ ] "You/your" appears 3x more than "I/we"?
- [ ] Tone sounds like a peer, not a vendor? (read aloud test)
- [ ] Personalization connects to the problem?
- [ ] One CTA, interest-based, under 6 words?
- [ ] Subject line: 2–4 words, lowercase, internal-looking?
- [ ] No jargon, feature dumps, or self-proclaimed superlatives?
- [ ] Passes the "so what?" test from prospect's perspective?

### Step 5: Generate follow-up sequence (if requested)

Write 2–4 follow-ups with different angles per [follow-up-sequences.md](references/follow-up-sequences.md).

## Output Format

Present each email as:

```
**Subject:** [subject line]
**Framework:** [framework used]
**Hook type:** [timeline/numbers/social proof/problem]

---

[Email body]

---

**Word count:** [N]
**Reading level:** [grade level]
**I/You ratio:** [ratio]
```

For sequences, present all emails with day numbers and angle labels.

## Anti-Patterns (never do these)

- Open with "I hope this email finds you well" or "My name is X and I work at Y"
- Use "synergy," "leverage," "circle back," "best-in-class," "leading provider"
- Include HTML formatting, images, or multiple links
- Pitch your product in the subject line
- Use fake "Re:" or "Fwd:" subject lines
- Send identical templates with only {{FirstName}} swapped
- Ask for 30-minute calls in first touch
- Write "just checking in" follow-ups
