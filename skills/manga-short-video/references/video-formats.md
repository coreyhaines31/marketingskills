## Format 1: The Emotional Hook

**Duration**: 15-30 seconds
**Difficulty**: Low
**Equipment**: Phone camera or text editing tool

### Shot-by-Shot Breakdown

| Timestamp | Visual | Audio | Text Overlay |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Creator close-up OR bold text fade-in on dark background | Music: subtle tension build | Hook question in large bold font |
| 0:03-0:15 | Creator speaking with intentional pauses OR kinetic text animation revealing one line at a time | Voice: measured pace, slight emotional weight | Key phrases highlighted in contrasting color |
| 0:15-0:20 | Slight zoom-in on creator's face OR final text card with genre/theme | Music: resolves or drops | CTA: "Follow for [genre] manga that [emotional promise]" |

### Production Notes

- **Camera**: Eye-level, slight off-center framing. Look directly into lens.
- **Lighting**: Soft, warm. Avoid harsh overhead. A ring light works well.
- **Background**: Simple — solid color wall, bookshelf slightly out of focus, or dark backdrop.
- **Text version**: Use CapCut or Canva. Black background, white serif font. One line at a time with 0.5s transitions.
- **Music**: Lo-fi, ambient, or genre-appropriate. Keep it low in the mix — voice is primary.

### Adaptation by Genre

| Genre | Mood | Color Palette | Music Style |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|
| Shonen/Action | Electric, urgent | Red/orange accents on dark | Driving beat, bass-heavy |
| Romance/Josei | Warm, intimate | Soft pink/gold on cream | Acoustic, piano |
| Horror/Psychological | Unsettling, cold | Desaturated blue/green on black | Dissonant ambient |
| Isekai/Fantasy | Vast, mysterious | Deep purple/teal | Orchestral or ethereal synth |

## Format 2: The World Builder

**Duration**: 30-60 seconds
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Equipment**: Video editor with stock footage access

### Shot-by-Shot Breakdown

| Timestamp | Visual | Audio | Text Overlay |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Establishing shot: wide landscape or cityscape matching the manga's setting mood. Slow pan or dolly. | Music: ambient intro, low tension | None — let visual breathe |
| 0:05-0:15 | Transition to mid-range footage: streets, interiors, natural environments. Shots that evoke the genre's atmosphere. | Voiceover begins: describe the world's feeling, not its facts | Subtle location/mood keywords fade in and out |
| 0:15-0:30 | Intimate footage: close-ups of rain, hands, light through windows, empty spaces. Focus shifts from environment to human scale. | Voiceover: shift from world to the people in it — their emotional reality | Key emotional phrase appears in larger text |
| 0:30-0:45 | Gradual warmth: footage becomes warmer, more inviting. Sunrise, warm interiors, gentle movement. | Voiceover: connect the world to the reader's potential experience | None |
| 0:45-0:55 | Slow fade or gentle transition to solid color background | Voiceover: final emotional promise | Text card: "Manga that builds worlds you'll feel in your chest" |
| 0:55-0:60 | Clean end card | Music fades | "Follow for more" + handle |

### Stock Footage Selection Guide

| Manga Setting/Genre | Recommended Stock Footage Keywords |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Urban/Modern | "Tokyo night," "neon city rain," "empty subway," "rooftop sunset" |
| Historical/Samurai | "Japanese temple," "bamboo forest," "mist mountains," "traditional architecture" |

- **Cool genres** (thriller, horror): Crush blacks, push shadows to blue/teal, desaturate reds
- **Epic genres** (fantasy, action): High contrast, saturated highlights, deep shadows
- **Nostalgic genres** (coming-of-age): Slight grain, lifted blacks, warm midtones

## Format 3: The Question Cascade

**Duration**: 15-30 seconds
**Difficulty**: Low
**Equipment**: Text editing tool (CapCut, Canva, After Effects)

### Shot-by-Shot Breakdown

| Timestamp | Visual | Audio | Text |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| 0:00-0:04 | Solid dark background. First question fades in, centered. | Music: single note or ambient drone | "What if [universal human scenario]?" |
| 0:04-0:08 | Sharp cut. Second question. Background may shift slightly in color. | Music: adds a second layer | "What if [consequence or complication]?" |
| 0:08-0:12 | Third question. Background darkens or shifts to contrasting tone. | Music: builds tension | "What if [emotional escalation]?" |
| 0:12-0:16 | Fourth question. Background reaches peak contrast. | Music: near climax | "What if [twist or philosophical turn]?" |
| 0:16-0:18 | Pause. Screen goes black or to single color. | Music: drops to silence or single tone | Nothing — let it breathe |
| 0:18-0:22 | Resolution text. Clean, confident. | Music: resolves gently | "Manga explores this." or "This is what [genre] manga asks." |
| 0:22-0:25 | CTA card | Music fades | "Follow for the manga that'll keep you thinking." |

### Question Writing Framework

Build questions using this escalation pattern:

1. **Universal**: Something everyone can relate to (love, fear, identity, ambition)
2. **Complication**: Add a twist that creates tension or moral complexity
3. **Escalation**: Raise the emotional stakes — make it personal
4. **Pivot**: Shift from plot-like to philosophical or artistic

**Example set (Psychological genre)**:
1. "What if you could see the truth behind every lie?"
2. "What if the first truth you uncovered was about yourself?"
3. "What if knowing the truth meant losing everyone you loved?"
4. "What if the only way to tell this story... was without words?"

**Example set (Romance genre)**:
1. "What if you met someone who understood you completely?"
2. "What if they were the one person you could never be with?"
3. "What if every moment together was borrowed time?"
4. "What if the most beautiful love story wasn't written — it was drawn?"

**Example set (Action/Sports genre)**:
1. "What if the only way forward was through?"
2. "What if your body was breaking but your spirit refused to stop?"
3. "What if winning meant becoming someone you didn't recognize?"
4. "What if the greatest battles weren't fought with fists — but with art?"

## Format 4: The Reader's Testimony

**Duration**: 30-60 seconds
**Difficulty**: Low-Medium
**Equipment**: Phone camera

### Shot-by-Shot Breakdown

| Timestamp | Visual | Audio | Tone |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Creator on camera, casual setup. Slightly off-center. | Speaking directly: confession tone | Honest, slightly vulnerable |
| 0:05-0:10 | Same shot — may cut to tighter framing | "Before" state: what they thought before manga | Self-deprecating or skeptical |
| 0:10-0:25 | B-roll optional: hands on book, bookshelf, reading nook. Or stay on creator with tighter framing. | The discovery moment: when and how manga changed their perspective | Building emotion, genuine |
| 0:25-0:40 | Back to creator, closer. More intimate framing. | The emotional impact: not plot details, but how it felt | Passionate but controlled |
| 0:40-0:50 | Creator looks directly at lens. Slight pause before speaking. | The universalization: why this matters for the viewer | Warm, inviting |
| 0:50-0:60 | Pull back slightly or cut to text card | CTA: invitation, not instruction | Encouraging |

### Authenticity Guidelines

This format lives and dies on **genuineness**. Follow these rules:

- **Don't script word-for-word** — use bullet points and speak naturally
- **Include imperfections** — a slight pause, a searching-for-words moment, a laugh
- **Show real emotion** — if something genuinely moved you, let that show
- **Avoid hyperbole** — "this changed my perspective" hits harder than "THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER"
- **Be specific** — "I stayed up until 4 AM on a Tuesday" is more credible than "I couldn't put it down"
- **Never name specific titles** in this format — keep it about the *experience*. Titles go in comments or follow-up content.

### B-Roll Ideas (No Copyright Issues)

- Hands holding a physical manga volume (cover facing away or partially visible)
- Bookshelf with manga collection (spines visible is fine — this is your property)
- Reading setup: desk, lamp, tea/coffee, blanket
- Phone/tablet showing a manga reading app interface (not the content)
- Time-lapse of a reading session (you, not the pages)
- Walking through a bookstore's manga section

### Shot-by-Shot Breakdown

| Timestamp | Visual | Audio | Text |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Striking Japanese cultural footage: temple, festival, craft, food | Music: traditional instrument blend or modern-traditional fusion | Japanese concept word in large text (romaji + meaning) |
| 0:05-0:15 | Continue cultural footage, slower pace. Mix wide and close-up. | Voiceover: explain the concept simply and compellingly | Brief English definition overlay |
| 0:15-0:30 | Transition: footage shifts from literal to abstract/atmospheric | Voiceover: why this concept resonates universally | Key phrase highlighted |
| 0:30-0:50 | Mood footage matching how this concept manifests in storytelling | Voiceover: how manga uniquely expresses this concept — through art, pacing, silence | "Only manga can..." statement |

### Genre Positioning Guides

**Shonen (Action/Adventure)**
- Misconception: "It's just fighting"
- Reality: It's about human willpower, the bonds forged through struggle, and what it means to never give up on someone
- Emotional range: Exhilaration → devastating loss → triumphant return → earned resolution
- Unique manga advantage: Fight choreography as visual art; the mangaka controls your eye movement through the page

**Seinen (Mature/Complex)**
- Misconception: "It's just dark and violent"
- Reality: It's literature in visual form — moral complexity, unreliable narrators, worlds that mirror our own uncomfortable truths
- Emotional range: Intellectual unease → empathetic horror → philosophical revelation → bittersweet understanding
- Unique manga advantage: Pacing control — a full page of silence can carry more weight than pages of dialogue

**Shojo/Josei (Romance/Emotional Drama)**
- Misconception: "It's just romance for girls"
- Reality: It's the most emotionally sophisticated storytelling genre — exploring identity, autonomy, desire, and the courage to be vulnerable
- Emotional range: Fluttering anticipation → heartbreak → self-discovery → earned love
- Unique manga advantage: Internal monologue as visual art; flower imagery and screen tones express feelings words cannot

**Horror/Psychological**
- Misconception: "It's just scary monsters"
- Reality: Japanese horror manga explores the terror of being human — isolation, obsession, the uncanny valley of identity
- Emotional range: Creeping unease → visceral shock → psychological dread → haunting reflection
- Unique manga advantage: The reader controls the pace of their own fear — turning each page is a choice to face what comes next

**Isekai/Fantasy**
- Misconception: "It's just escapist power fantasy"
- Reality: The best isekai uses a new world to examine what we take for granted in our own — identity, purpose, the systems we live within
- Emotional range: Wonder → culture shock → moral dilemma → redefined purpose
- Unique manga advantage: World-building through art — entire civilizations conveyed in a single panoramic spread

## Cross-Format Production Tips

### Audio & Music

- **Never use copyrighted music** — use royalty-free libraries: Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or TikTok's commercial library
- Match BPM to content energy: 60-80 BPM for emotional, 100-120 for narrative, 120+ for action
- Use **music drops** (sudden silence) at key emotional moments
- Layer ambient sound effects under music for depth (rain, city, wind)

### Text & Typography

- **Maximum 8 words per text overlay** — shorter is always better
- Use **serif fonts** for emotional/literary tone, **sans-serif** for modern/action
- Text should be readable in 1.5 seconds — if it takes longer, split it
- Use **color coding** consistently: one accent color per genre or mood
- Ensure text is within the safe zone (away from platform UI elements)

### Pacing

- **First 3 seconds determine everything** — front-load the most compelling element
- **Cut on emotion, not logic** — transition when the feeling peaks, not when the sentence ends
- **Use breathing room** — 1-2 seconds of silence or visual pause between major beats
- **End strong** — the last 3 seconds should leave an emotional imprint, not just display a CTA
