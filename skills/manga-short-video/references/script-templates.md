## Core Scripts (Genre-Neutral)

### Script A: "The Feeling" — Emotional Hook (20s)

```
[HOOK - 3 seconds]
(Creator on camera, or bold text on screen)
"Have you ever finished a story and just... sat there?"

[BODY - 12 seconds]
"Not because it was sad. Not because it was happy.
Because it made you feel something you didn't have a word for.
That's what Japanese manga does differently.
It doesn't just tell you a story — it puts you inside one."

[CTA - 5 seconds]
"Follow for the manga that'll do that to you."
```

**Hook variations**:
- "There's a kind of story that rewires your brain."
- "Name one Western comic that made you cry at 3 AM."
- "The best story I've ever experienced wasn't a book, a movie, or a show."

---

### Script B: "Another World" — World Builder (45s)

```
[VISUAL: Slow pan across moody cityscape. Rain. Neon reflections.]
[MUSIC: Lo-fi ambient, gentle tension]

[VOICEOVER]
"Imagine a city that never sleeps.
Not because it's alive with energy —
because the people in it are afraid of what happens
when the lights go out."

[VISUAL: Transition to intimate footage — empty train, dimly lit room]
"Now imagine living in that city.
Not as a hero. Not as a villain.
As someone just trying to figure out who they are."

[VISUAL: Slow fade to warm light]
"Japanese manga builds worlds like this.
Not just settings — places you feel in your chest.
Worlds where every page is a doorway."

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Manga that builds worlds you'll never want to leave."]
[TEXT: "Follow for more."]
```

---

### Script C: "What If" — Question Cascade (20s)

```
[MUSIC: Building electronic pulse]
[TEXT appears one at a time, sharp transitions]

"What if you could read someone's emotions?"
"What if that power destroyed every relationship you had?"
"What if the only person who understood... was your enemy?"
"What if the answer wasn't in words — but in art?"

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]
[TEXT: "Manga asks the questions other media won't."]
[TEXT: "Follow for the ones that'll keep you up at night."]
```

---

### Script D: "Before and After" — Reader's Testimony (40s)

```
[Creator on camera, casual, genuine]
"I'm going to be honest with you.
I used to think manga was just... anime on paper."

[Slight pause, shift in tone]
"Then I read one series — I'm not going to tell you which one yet —
and I stayed up until 4 AM on a Tuesday.
Not because of plot twists.
Because I had never seen a character go through something
that felt so specifically like MY experience."

[Leaning in]
"That's the thing about manga.
The best ones don't just entertain you.
They make you feel less alone."

[Softer]
"If you've never read manga before, you're not late.
You're right on time."

[TEXT: "Follow — I'll show you where to start."]
```

---

### Script E: "The Art of Silence" — Cultural Gateway (60s)

```
[VISUAL: Japanese temple in morning mist. Slow, meditative.]
[MUSIC: Soft koto or ambient piano]

[TEXT ON SCREEN: "Ma (間)" — large, elegant]

[VOICEOVER]
"In Japanese culture, there's a concept called 'ma.'
It means the space between things.
The pause in a conversation. The silence between notes.
Not emptiness — presence."

[VISUAL: Transition to quiet urban footage — empty crosswalk, wind through curtains]
"Western storytelling fills every moment with words, action, noise.
Japanese manga understands that sometimes the most powerful thing
a story can do... is stop."

[VISUAL: Close-up of hands, a window, light shifting]
"A full page with no dialogue. No narration.
Just a character standing in the rain,
and somehow you feel everything they're feeling."

[VISUAL: Warm, gentle footage — sunset, calm water]
"That's 'ma.' And once you experience it in manga,
every other medium feels like it's trying too hard."

[TEXT: "Manga that speaks loudest in silence."]
[TEXT: "Follow for more."]
```

---

### Script F: "Your Brain on Manga" — Intellectual Hook (30s)

```
[Creator on camera, or kinetic text]
"Here's something most people don't know about manga."

"You read it right to left. Back to front.
Your brain has to completely rewire how it processes a page."

"And that's not a bug — that's the feature."

"Because when your brain is working differently,
you experience stories differently.
Emotions hit from angles you don't expect.
Plot twists land harder because your eyes weren't
where they usually are."

"Manga doesn't just tell you a different kind of story.
It makes you a different kind of reader."

[TEXT: "Ready to think differently? Follow."]
```

---

## Genre-Specific Scripts

### Shonen/Action — "The Weight of a Punch" (30s)

```
[VISUAL: Atmospheric footage — storm clouds, crashing waves, intense light]
[MUSIC: Building percussion, bass-heavy]

[VOICEOVER]
"In most action stories, a punch is just a punch."

"In manga, a punch carries the weight of
a promise made to a dead friend,
three hundred chapters of growth,
and one character's refusal to let the world break them."

"That's why manga fights make you cry.
It was never about the punch.
It was about everything behind it."

[MUSIC drops]
[TEXT: "Manga where every battle means everything."]
[TEXT: "Follow for more."]
```

---

### Romance/Josei — "The Space Between" (35s)

```
[VISUAL: Soft, warm footage — cherry blossoms, cafe window, rain on glass]
[MUSIC: Gentle piano or acoustic guitar]

[VOICEOVER]
"The best romance stories in the world
aren't about the kiss."

"They're about the moment before.
The held breath. The almost-touch.
The look that says everything
neither character has the courage to say out loud."

"Japanese manga stretches that moment
across an entire page.
No words. Just two people
and the electricity between them."

"Western romance tells you characters are in love.
Manga makes you feel it in your stomach."

[TEXT: "Manga that makes your heart ache beautifully."]
[TEXT: "Follow."]
```

---

### Horror/Psychological — "The Page Turn" (25s)

```
[VISUAL: Dark, desaturated footage — flickering light, empty hallway, fog]
[MUSIC: Dissonant ambient, barely audible]

[VOICEOVER]
"Here's the thing about horror manga
that no movie can replicate."

[PAUSE - beat of silence]

"You control the pace."

"Every page turn is YOUR choice.
You know something terrible is on the next page.
Your fingers are on the corner.
And you turn it anyway."

"That's not a jumpscare. That's dread you chose.
And it stays with you."

[SILENCE - 2 seconds]
[TEXT: "Manga that makes you afraid of your own curiosity."]
```

---

### Seinen/Literary — "Gray Areas" (40s)

```
[VISUAL: Urban twilight footage — city at dusk, silhouettes, reflections in glass]
[MUSIC: Atmospheric, slightly melancholic]

[VOICEOVER]
"Western stories love a hero."

"Someone clearly good. A villain clearly bad.
A moral compass that always points north."

[VISUAL: Footage becomes more ambiguous — crowds, blurred faces, rain]
"Seinen manga doesn't do that."

"It gives you a character who does terrible things
for understandable reasons.
A world where the 'right' answer
depends on which page you're reading."

"And it doesn't tell you how to feel about it.
It trusts you to sit with the discomfort."

[VISUAL: Single light source in darkness]
"That's not entertainment. That's literature.
And it happens to come with some of the most
stunning visual art you've ever seen."

[TEXT: "Manga for people who don't want easy answers."]
[TEXT: "Follow."]
```

---

### Isekai/Fantasy — "The Door" (35s)

```
[VISUAL: Mystical nature footage — ancient forest, aurora, mist over water]
[MUSIC: Ethereal, wonder-inducing]

[VOICEOVER]
"What if tomorrow you opened a door
and the world on the other side
had completely different rules?"

"Different physics. Different morals.
Different definitions of what it means to be human."

"That's not just a fantasy premise.
That's what reading isekai manga actually feels like."

"Except the world on the other side
is so detailed, so alive, so carefully constructed,
that you start to question
whether your world is the real one."

[VISUAL: Transition from mystical to warm, grounded footage]
"The best manga doesn't just transport you.
It makes you homesick for a place that doesn't exist."

[TEXT: "Manga that builds worlds you'll miss."]
[TEXT: "Follow for more."]
```

---

### Sports Manga — "The One Percent" (30s)

```
[VISUAL: Athletic footage — running, sweat, dawn training, empty court]
[MUSIC: Building, inspirational but restrained]

[VOICEOVER]
"Sports movies give you the big game.
The training montage. The last-second win."

"Sports manga gives you the 4 AM alarm.
The hundredth failed attempt.
The moment your body says stop
and your mind says one more."

"It gives you two hundred chapters of a kid
learning that talent is nothing
without the stubbornness to keep showing up."

"That's why sports manga makes people cry
who don't even watch sports."

[TEXT: "Manga that makes effort feel sacred."]
[TEXT: "Follow."]
```

---

### Slice-of-Life — "The Ordinary" (30s)

```
[VISUAL: Warm daily life footage — morning light, cooking, walking, sunset]
[MUSIC: Lo-fi, gentle, warm]

[VOICEOVER]
"There's a genre of manga
where nothing happens."

"No battles. No romance. No mystery to solve."

"Just a person living their life.
Making breakfast. Walking to work.
Watching the seasons change."

[Pause]
"And somehow, it's the most healing thing
you've ever read."

"Because it reminds you that your ordinary life —
the small moments you rush through —
is someone else's idea of a beautiful story."

[TEXT: "Manga that makes the everyday feel extraordinary."]
[TEXT: "Follow."]
```

## Series & Recurring Formats

### Weekly Series: "Manga Emotion of the Week" (15-20s each)

Each episode explores one emotion that manga captures uniquely.

**Episode template**:
```
[TEXT: "[EMOTION]" — large, centered, 2 seconds]

[Creator on camera or voiceover with mood footage]
"The Japanese have a word for [concept].
It means [brief definition].

Western stories [what they do].
Manga [what manga does differently].

And once you feel it, you'll look for it in everything."

[TEXT: "[Emotion] — only in manga."]
[TEXT: "Follow for next week's emotion."]
```

**Episode ideas**:
1. Setsunai (切ない) — A sadness too beautiful to be called pain

3. Moe (萌え) — The protective tenderness toward a character
4. Chuunibyou (中二病) — The embarrassing grandiosity of adolescence

6. Aware (哀れ) — The poignant beauty of things passing
7. Kuyashii (悔しい) — Frustration so sharp it becomes fuel
8. Tokimeki (ときめき) — The heart-flutter of romantic possibility

---

### Series: "Manga vs. Every Other Medium" (20-30s each)

Compare how manga handles a specific storytelling element vs. film, TV, novels, etc.

**Episode template**:
```
[TEXT: "[ELEMENT] in movies vs. manga"]

"In movies, [element] works like [this].
In novels, [element] works like [this].

In manga, [element] works like [this].

And the difference isn't small.
It's the difference between being told a story
and being inside one."

[TEXT: "Manga does [element] differently."]
```

**Episode ideas**:
1. Silence — Film uses score. Novels use description. Manga uses empty panels.
2. Time — Film is locked to real-time. Manga can stretch a second across ten pages.
3. Fear — Film uses jumpscares. Manga uses the page turn.
4. Love — Film shows the kiss. Manga shows the moment before.
5. Power — Film shows the explosion. Manga shows what it cost.
6. Loss — Film shows tears. Manga shows an empty chair.

---

### Series: "One Japanese Word That Changes Everything" (15-20s each)

```
[TEXT: Large Japanese word in calligraphy style]
[TEXT below: Romaji pronunciation]

[Creator or voiceover]
"[Word] means [definition].
There's no English equivalent.

But if you've read [genre] manga,
you've felt it.

It's [vivid description of when you feel this].

And the fact that Japanese has a word for it —
and we don't —
is exactly why their stories hit different."

[TEXT: "[Word]. Only in manga."]
```

---

## Script Adaptation Guidelines

### Adjusting for Platform Length

**TikTok (15s version)**: Keep only the hook + one emotional beat + CTA. Cut all context.

**Instagram Reels (30s version)**: Hook + emotional core + one supporting detail + CTA.

**YouTube Shorts (60s version)**: Full script — hook + context + emotional journey + CTA.

### Adjusting for Audience Segment

| Audience | Tone Shift | Vocabulary | Emotional Angle |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| Anime fans who haven't read manga | Reference anime as entry point; "The anime was amazing — but the manga..." | Can use terms like shonen, seinen, isekai freely | "There's more to discover" |
| BookTok / general readers | Position manga alongside literature; avoid anime comparisons | Avoid jargon; use "graphic novel," "visual storytelling" | "A new kind of reading experience" |
| Existing manga readers | Speak as insider; deeper cuts, genre nuance | Full manga vocabulary welcome | "You know the feeling — help us spread it" |
| Complete newcomers | No assumptions; start from zero | Plain English only; explain all concepts | "You're about to discover something incredible" |

### Localization Notes for North American Audiences

- **Pronunciation guides**: If using Japanese terms, include phonetic pronunciation naturally: "It's called 'mono no aware' — MOH-no no ah-WAH-reh"
- **Cultural references**: Frame Japanese concepts through universal emotions first, then add the cultural layer
- **Avoid gatekeeping tone**: Never make the viewer feel ignorant. Position new concepts as exciting discoveries, not knowledge tests
- **Regional sensitivity**: North America includes diverse audiences — avoid assumptions about prior cultural exposure
- **Humor style**: Dry, self-aware humor works well. Avoid forced enthusiasm or exaggerated reactions that feel inauthentic
