## Content Strategy Framework

### 1. Content Pillars

Content pillars are the 3-5 core topics your brand will be known for. They should:
- Align with your product/service
- Match what your audience cares about

**How to identify pillars:**

1. **Product-led**: What problems does your product solve?
2. **Audience-led**: What does your ICP need to learn?
3. **Search-led**: What topics have volume in your space?
4. **Competitor-led**: What are competitors ranking for?

**Pillar structure:**
```
Pillar Topic
├── Subtopic Cluster 1
│   ├── Article A
│   ├── Article B
│   └── Article C
├── Subtopic Cluster 2
│   ├── Article D
│   ├── Article E
│   └── Article F
└── Subtopic Cluster 3
    ├── Article G
    ├── Article H
    └── Article I
```

7. **Refresh the publish date** — Signal freshness to Google

### Content Pruning

Sometimes content should be removed:
- No traffic and no strategic value
- Outdated beyond repair

- Duplicate or cannibalized content

Options:
- 301 redirect to better content
