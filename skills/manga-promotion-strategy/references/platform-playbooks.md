# Platform Playbooks for Manga Promotion

Detailed strategies for each social media platform when promoting manga to North American audiences.

## TikTok (MangaTok)

### Why TikTok Matters for Manga

TikTok is the single most powerful discovery platform for manga in North America. BookTok drove massive print sales for novels, and MangaTok is doing the same for manga. Titles that go viral on TikTok see immediate sales spikes at retailers.

### Content Formats That Work

**Manga Reactions (Highest Engagement)**
- Film yourself reading a chapter for the first time
- Genuine emotional reactions drive shares
- Keep videos 30-60 seconds, focus on one key moment
- Use trending audio when it fits naturally

**Recommendation Videos**
- "Manga that will make you [emotion]"
- "If you liked [popular title], read [your title]"
- "Underrated manga you need to read"
- Stack physical volumes visually for aesthetic appeal

**Manga Hauls & Collections**
- Showcase new releases and special editions
- Shelf tours and collection reveals
- Unboxing special editions and box sets

**Educational Content**
- "How to read manga" for newcomers
- Genre explainers with visual examples

- Behind-the-scenes of the publishing process

### Posting Strategy

- **Best times**: 6-9 PM EST on weekdays, 12-3 PM on weekends
- **Hashtags**: #manga #mangatok #mangarecommendation #[title] #[genre]tok
- **Audio**: Use trending sounds when they fit; original audio for reactions
- **Length**: 15-60 seconds for discovery, up to 3 minutes for reviews

### Growth Tactics

1. Duet/stitch popular manga content to join conversations
2. Respond to comments with video replies
3. Create series content (e.g., "Rating every volume of [title]")
4. Participate in manga-related challenges and trends
5. Post consistently for 30 days to build algorithmic favor

### Posting Strategy

- **Frequency**: 3-7 tweets/day (mix of original and engagement)

- **Best times**: Align with chapter release times, 12 PM and 5-7 PM EST
- **Thread format**: Use for announcements, recommendations, and deep dives

### Key Tactics

1. Follow and engage with manga reviewers and fan accounts

### YouTube Shorts

- Repurpose TikTok/Reels content as Shorts
- Panel reveals with dramatic music
- Quick 30-second recommendations
- Reaction clips from longer videos

### Channel Strategy

- **Upload frequency**: 1-2 long-form videos per week, 3-5 Shorts

## Reddit

### Relevant Subreddits

| Subreddit | Members | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/manga | Very large | General manga news and discussion |
| r/MangaCollectors | Large | Physical volume promotion, special editions |
| r/Shonen | Medium | Shonen title promotion |
| r/OtakuCulture | Medium | Broader anime/manga culture |
| Genre-specific subs | Varies | Targeted niche audiences |

### Content Strategy

**What works on Reddit:**
- Genuine discussion posts, not promotional announcements
- AMAs (Ask Me Anything) with translators, editors, or creators
- Exclusive first-chapter previews shared as image galleries
- Thoughtful analysis of themes and storytelling
- Sharing news from official sources (not direct self-promotion)

**What doesn't work:**
- Obvious promotional posts (will be downvoted and possibly removed)
- Spamming multiple subreddits with the same content
- Ignoring subreddit rules about self-promotion
- Not engaging with comments on your posts

### Best Practices

1. Become a genuine community member before promoting
2. Follow the 90/10 rule: 90% valuable participation, 10% promotion
3. Use Reddit's AMA format for authentic engagement
4. Share exclusive content that provides real value
5. Always be transparent about your role (publisher, marketer, etc.)

## Discord

### Community Building

Discord is where the most dedicated manga fans gather for ongoing conversation.

**Server Structure for a Manga Community:**
- Welcome channel with server rules and reading guides
- General chat for casual discussion
- Chapter discussion channels (with spoiler tags)
- Fan art and fan creation channels
- Manga recommendations channel
- Announcements channel for official news
- Voice channels for reading group sessions

### Engagement Tactics

- **Reading groups**: Schedule monthly read-alongs of specific volumes
- **Live events**: Host Q&As with editors, translators, or mangaka
- **Exclusive previews**: Share sneak peeks before public release
- **Reaction roles**: Let members self-select genres they follow
- **Fan spotlights**: Weekly features of community fan art or discussions
- **Manga trivia**: Regular quiz events with prizes (signed volumes, merch)

### Growth Strategy

1. Promote the Discord server on all other platforms
2. Offer Discord-exclusive content (early previews, behind-the-scenes)
3. Partner with existing manga Discord communities for cross-promotion
4. Feature active community members to encourage participation
5. Keep moderation active—toxic communities lose members quickly
