# Listening Sources — Template

Save this as a **knowledge item** attached to your social agent (a Dust Folder file, or a connected Notion/Google Doc), or keep the essentials in **Agent Memory**. The agent reads it when running the [listening workflow](listening.md).

Delete sections you don't use. Keep this short and current — stale sources are worse than no sources.

## What We're Listening For

**Brand / product:** [Your product name]
**Category:** [e.g., "AI writing assistant", "Postgres GUI"]
**Goal:** [e.g., "find people switching from Notion", "engage with B2B SaaS founders 50-200 employees"]

## ICP (for scoring)

Used by the [scoring rubric](listening.md#scoring-rubric) to judge ICP fit.

## Notes for the agent

- When asked for "today's top 10," output in the format defined in [listening.md](listening.md#the-daily-triage-loop)
- For LinkedIn and X, use **Computer**/**Browse** in a signed-in browser session (the user is logged in)
- For everything else, use the public sources and connectors in [listening.md](listening.md#sources--how-to-pull-them)
- Default lookback: 24h. User can override.
- Always ask before posting — output drafts, user approves and posts (or posts via a connector once approved)
