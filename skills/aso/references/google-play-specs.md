| Metric                       | Overall Threshold | Per-Device Threshold |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| User-Perceived Crash Rate    | **1.09%**         | 8%                   |
| User-Perceived ANR Rate      | **0.47%**         | 8%                   |
| Excessive Partial Wake Locks | 5%                | N/A                  |

**Consequences:** Reduced search visibility, warning labels on listing, quality alerts to users before install.
**Recovery:** Google checks daily using 28-day rolling average.

## Search Ranking — Official Factors

Google confirms these affect ranking:

1. **Metadata relevance** — Title carries most weight. NLP scans title + short desc + full desc.
2. **App quality** — Android Vitals (crash/ANR rates)
3. **Ratings and reviews** — Star rating + review text. 85% of featured apps have 4.0+
4. **Install volume and velocity** — Total installs + daily/weekly frequency
5. **Engagement and retention** — Session frequency, duration, retention rates
6. **Update frequency** — Regular updates signal active maintenance
7. **Localization** — Regional keyword/visual adaptation. 59% of US apps localize titles.
